		<h1>Car Maintenance</h1>
		<h4>SHORT TERM CHECK-UPS</h4>
		<p>For proper vehicle maintenance, inspect the following:</p>
	</section>

  <section>
  	<h1>OIL AND COOLANT LEVELS</h1>
  	<p>Every month, or every few gas fill-ups and especially before any longer road trips, it’s a good idea to get under the hood of your car and inspect both the oil and coolant levels while the engine is cool. Low levels of either can lead to engine problems if left unchecked. Refer to your owner’s manual to locate both on your specific vehicle.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>AIR FILTER</h1>
  	<p>Your engine’s air filter is what regulates the air that flows into your engine and helps keep out debris and particulate. By making certain that your air filter is flowing properly, you can improve your fuel efficiency, decrease your emissions, and help ensure the life of your engine. This can be done easily at home, so check your owner’s manual for instructions and how often it needs to be changed.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>TIRE PRESSURE AND TREAD DEPTH</h1>
  	<p>Since well-maintained tires are integral to a safe, fuel-efficient ride, make it a habit to visually inspect your tires often. Check the pressure in your tires every month, and before long trips or carrying extra load.  Don’t forget the spare.  A tire pressure gauge will be needed to check your tire pressure. Also, during the colder months, note that tire pressure drops one pound with every 10 degree decrease in pressure. Your owner’s manual will tell you how much air pressure your tire needs. You can check your tread depth using the simple penny method.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>HEADLIGHTS, TURN SIGNALS, BRAKE, AND PARKING LIGHTS</h1>
  	<p>It’s important that the lights on your vehicle are properly functioning, but oftentimes it can be easy item to overlook. Once a month, turn on your headlights when you’re parked in front of a flat surface and check that both headlights are working properly and well-positioned. Walk around your car and visually inspect both turn signals and your parking lights. Have a friend stand behind the car while you engage the brakes to be certain that your brake lights are functional.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>OIL & FILTER</h1>
	<p>The motor oil in your vehicle’s engine serves a whole slew of functions: it lubricates the moving parts, helps act as a sealant against debris, cools the engine, reduces wear and tear, and helps prevent engine corrosion. Keeping it clean is vital for good engine health. Depending on your car and what kind of oil you’re using, you may need to change both the oil & oil filter as much as every 3 months or 3000 miles. Many newer vehicles’ owners’ manuals will recommend changing your oil less frequently – often in-between 5,000 and 10,000 miles. Check your vehicle owner’s manual and consult with a professional to be certain what is appropriate for your vehicle.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>ROTATE TIRES</h1>
  	<p>Depending on your vehicle alignment, usage, and many other factors, the tread wear patterns on your tires may vary between the front and back tires, or even from one side of the tread to the other. Rotating your tires will help to extend the service life of your tires by more evenly balancing the tread wear, and helping prevent noise and vibration problems.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>WAX VEHICLE</h1>
  	<p>Making certain to wax your vehicle every six months after washing it won’t just keep it shiny, it’ll also help to keep both the paint in good shape and reduce the chance of rust. Many irritants such as dust, sand, and salt can build up and environmental factors like ozone and ultraviolet light can cause microscopic damage, but waxing can help minimize this by forming a protective seal to extend your paint’s life.</p>
  </section>
  <h1>LONG TERM CHECK-UPS</h1>
  <section>
  	<h1>TRANSMISSION FLUID</h1>
  	<p>Much like the oil in your engine, transmission fluid is a lubricant that helps keep all of the moving parts inside of your transmission functioning properly. Whether you’re driving an automatic or manual transmission vehicle, it is essential that you have your transmission fluid checked and changed when needed to avoid costly transmission damage or replacement. Follow the vehicle manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>TRANSFER CASE FLUID</h1>
  	<p>In four-wheel or all-wheel drive vehicles, the transfer case is what shifts power from the transmission to the axles. You’ll need to have the transfer case fluid checked according to the vehicle manufacturer recommendations to make certain that it is properly filled and leak-free. This will require you getting under the vehicle, so bringing it into a professional is recommended.</p>
  </section>
   <section>
   	<h1>INSPECT SHOCKS AND STRUTS</h1>
   	<p>The shocks and struts on your car function to control the impact and rebound as your vehicle passes over bumps in the road and are an essential part of your auto’s steering system. They should be inspected by a professional every 50,000 miles or bring your car in to the shop if you notice a decrease in smoothness or loss of control when driving.</p>
   </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>COOLANT FLUID EXCHANGE</h1>
  	<p>The radiator in your car is a vital component that helps keep your engine cool and functioning properly. Having your coolant system flushed regularly will help get rid of contaminants that can build up inside as well as ensure that your radiator is filled to a proper level. Check your vehicle manufacturer’s recommendation to find out how often your coolant should be exchanged,</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>SPARK PLUGS</h1>
  	<p>The spark plugs in your engine ignite the gas and air mixture that ultimately powers your vehicle . If your spark plugs aren’t functioning properly, your engine will lose power and won’t run at optimal capacity. Have a professional check and replace any faulty spark plugs depending on vehicle mfr recommendations or when you feel a decrease in your engine’s power.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>SERPENTINE BELT</h1>
  	<p>Although may seem like a simple piece of rubber, your vehicle’s serpentine belt is essential to keeping your car running by powering peripheral devices such as your alternator, power steering pump, and air conditioner compressor. Visually inspect the belt to ensure that it is free of cracks or other wear and tear.  Replace id damaged or according to your vehicle manufacture’s recommendation.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1>FRONT AND/OR REAR DIFFERENTIAL</h1>
  	<p>The differentials are devices that split the torque—or power—from the engine and allow it to send power to the tires. In front or rear-wheel drive vehicles, there is only one differential, but in 4-wheel and all-wheel drive vehicles, there is both a front and rear differential, and possibly even a center differential. Like many parts of your vehicle, the differentials need to be kept lubricated to ensure proper functionality. Have a professional check and change fluid whenever your vehicle manufacturer recommends it.</p>
